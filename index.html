                        A social media analysis task usually involves processing
                        of multimodal information in order to obtain valuable
                        insights about the data, a situation, or a higher-level
                        activity. Examples of social media analysis tasks
                        include semantic concept detection, audio-visual speaker
                        detection, human tracking, event detection, etc. The
                        existing literature on multimodal fusion research in
                        social media is presented through several
                        classifications based on the fusion methodology and the
                        level of fusion (such as feature-level, decision-level,
                        and hybrid). In this workshop, we welcome the research
                        works aiming to solve the issues related to multimodal
                        information analysis in social media.
